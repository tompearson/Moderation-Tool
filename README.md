## ‚ö†Ô∏è Important Disclaimer

**AI Response Reliability**: While this tool provides AI-powered moderation analysis, AI responses may occasionally contain errors, inconsistencies, or unexpected behavior. The AI analysis is intended to assist your decision-making process, not replace human judgment.

**Use Your Own Judgment**: Always review the AI's recommendations carefully and apply your own judgment when handling flagged content. Consider the context, community standards, and specific circumstances of each case. The final moderation decision and responsibility rests with you as the human moderator.

**Tool Limitations**: This tool is designed to support moderation workflows but should not be used as the sole basis for content decisions. Use it as part of a broader moderation strategy that includes human oversight and community guidelines.
