### 📅 Release Date
December 2024

### 🚀 What's New

#### 🔧 **Consolidated Moderation Rules**
- **Single Source of Truth**: Removed `.cursorrules` file and consolidated all moderation rules into `moderate.js`
- **Improved Reliability**: Hardcoded rules as string constant eliminates file system dependencies
- **Better Maintainability**: No more duplicate rule management across multiple files

#### ⚡ **Enhanced API Reliability**
- **Robust Error Handling**: Improved fallback mechanisms for AI model failures
- **Better Response Parsing**: More flexible parsing with comprehensive fallback options
- **Enhanced Logging**: Comprehensive logging for better debugging and monitoring

#### 📝 **Improved Character Limit Handling**
- **Dynamic Prompt Engineering**: Intelligent prompt adjustment based on character limits
- **Smart Truncation**: Better handling of long responses to fit within limits
- **Complete Thoughts**: Ensures responses complete thoughts rather than abrupt truncation

#### 🧹 **Codebase Cleanup**
- **Eliminated Duplication**: Removed redundant rule definitions
- **Streamlined Deployment**: Fewer file dependencies for more reliable deployments
- **Better Organization**: Cleaner, more maintainable code structure
