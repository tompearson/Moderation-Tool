### Create the criteria document from all of the NextDoor rules ###
I want you to build a pretty moderation document using the instructions:
Be very detaild detailed. Do not leave out any information.
Include every detail, break down all tables into readable text.
Include all content (but not links) and break down all tables into the appropriate text.
Include the section named "Our commitment to our neighbors" in https://help.nextdoor.com/s/article/Do-not-discriminate?language=en_US


Here is the sources for you to input. Use all of these sources.
