# ‚öñÔ∏è Moderation Guide: Contextual Interpretation Approach

*Curated with Copilot - August 14, 2025*

**Current version:** Loading...  
*Last updated: August 15, 2025*

---

This guide helps moderators apply the **Contextual Interpretation** approach to moderation. This approach allows posts that are respectful, civic-minded, and avoid identifying individuals, while considering tone and intent. It includes specific prompting questions and test examples for training.

## üìã Table of Contents

- [‚öñÔ∏è Contextual Interpretation Philosophy](#contextual-interpretation-philosophy)
- [üîç Moderator Prompts](#moderator-prompts)
- [‚úÖ Allow If](#allow-if)
- [üö´ Remove If](#remove-if)
- [üß™ Test Examples for Contextual Approach](#test-examples-for-contextual-approach)

---

## ‚öñÔ∏è Contextual Interpretation Philosophy

**Allow posts that are respectful, civic-minded, and avoid identifying individuals. Tone and intent matter.**

This approach takes a balanced stance that considers the context, tone, and purpose of posts. It allows for civic engagement while maintaining community standards. The philosophy is that respectful, constructive content should be preserved, even if it touches on sensitive topics.

---

## üîç Moderator Prompts

When evaluating posts using the Contextual Interpretation approach, ask yourself:

- Is the post written in neutral, factual language?
- Does it avoid naming individuals or showing identifying details?
- Is the purpose clearly civic (e.g. encouraging outreach to officials, raising awareness)?
- Are comments respectful and constructive‚Äîor are they escalating into shaming or hostility?
- Would removing this post silence a legitimate concern, or prevent stigmatization?

---

## ‚úÖ Allow If

Posts are **allowed** if they meet **ALL** of these criteria:

- The post avoids personal identifiers and uses neutral tone.
- It encourages civic action (e.g. reporting to city services) rather than public judgment.
- Comments remain civil and focused on solutions.
- The purpose is clearly civic engagement or community awareness.
- No specific individuals are named or targeted.

---

## üö´ Remove If

Posts are **removed** if **ANY** of these conditions are met:

- The post includes accusations or identifying details (even if tone is respectful).
- Comments escalate into shaming or hostile speculation.
- The subject is a vulnerable group and the post risks amplifying stigma.
- The tone is inflammatory or invites divisive discussion.
- The purpose is to vent, target, or shame rather than inform.

---

## üß™ Test Examples for Contextual Approach

### ‚úÖ Usage Notes
- These test cases demonstrate how the Contextual Interpretation approach would handle various scenarios.
- Examples show the **balanced approach** that considers tone, intent, and civic value.
- Use these cases in training to reinforce the nuanced decision-making philosophy.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 1: Vague Concern Near Landmark

**Post**: "Something feels off near the old train station. Lots of people loitering and strange behavior. Just be careful."

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: No identifiers; tone is cautious but not accusatory. The post provides a general safety warning without targeting specific individuals.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 2: Direct Accusation Without Details

**Post**: "Someone in this neighborhood is selling drugs. I've seen shady exchanges but no proof."

**Action**: üö´ Remove

**Rationale**: Accusatory tone, even without identifiers. The post implies criminal behavior and invites speculation without providing constructive solutions.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 3: Civic Resource Sharing

**Post**: "If you're worried about safety, check out the city's new reporting app. It's a great way to stay involved."

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: Encourages civic engagement respectfully. The post provides a constructive resource without targeting individuals or locations.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 4: Comment Veers into Shaming

**Original Post**: "There's a group camping near the library. Just a heads-up."  
**Comment**: "They're disgusting. Always leaving trash and yelling at people."

**Action**: üö´ Remove Comment, Possibly Post

**Rationale**: Comment escalates tone with hostile language. The original post may be allowed if it's purely informational, but the comment violates tone standards.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 5: Photo Without Identifiers

**Post**: *Photo of a park bench* "This is where I saw someone passed out yesterday. Not sure what's going on."

**Action**: üö´ Remove

**Rationale**: Tone invites speculation, even without identifiers. The post implies wrongdoing and could stigmatize vulnerable individuals.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 6: Respectful Outreach

**Post**: "There's a tent near the trail. If you're concerned, contact outreach services. Let's be kind."

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: Tone is respectful, purpose is civic. The post encourages constructive action rather than judgment or speculation.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 7: Subtle Implication of Criminal Activity

**Post**: "I've noticed a lot of people hanging around the corner of 5th and Main late at night. It's making me uneasy."

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: No direct accusations; tone is cautious but not inflammatory. The post expresses a legitimate safety concern without targeting individuals.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 8: Sharing a News Article with a Loaded Caption

**Post**: *Shares a news article about a local crime* "This is why our neighborhood is going downhill. We need to do something about these people."

**Action**: üö´ Remove

**Rationale**: Tone of the caption invites divisive or harmful discussion. Even though the article itself is neutral, the caption violates tone standards.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 9: Hypothetical Scenario with Negative Implications

**Post**: "What if someone set up a tent in front of your house? How would you feel about that?"

**Action**: üö´ Remove

**Rationale**: While not directly accusatory, the tone is provocative and risks escalating tension. The hypothetical question invites divisive responses.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 10: Positive Post with a Specific Location

**Post**: "Shoutout to the volunteers cleaning up the park near 8th Street! You're making a difference!"

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: Positive tone and civic engagement outweigh location mention. The post celebrates community contribution rather than targeting individuals.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 11: Comment with Veiled Insult

**Original Post**: "There's a group of people near the library. Just a heads-up."  
**Comment**: "Well, some people just don't know how to behave in public."

**Action**: üö´ Remove Comment, Possibly Post

**Rationale**: Comment escalates tone with veiled insult. The original post may be allowed if it's purely informational, but the comment violates tone standards.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 12: Sharing a Resource with a Negative Anecdote

**Post**: "I saw someone struggling near the bus stop today. If you see this kind of thing, here's a hotline you can call to help."

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: Tone is compassionate and provides a helpful resource. The post encourages constructive action rather than judgment.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 13: Sarcastic Comment on a Neutral Post

**Original Post**: "There's a new community garden opening downtown. Check it out!"  
**Comment**: "Great, another place for people to trash."

**Action**: üö´ Remove Comment

**Rationale**: Comment is unnecessarily negative but post is neutral. The contextual approach allows the positive post while removing the sarcastic comment.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 14: Vague Concern About a Group

**Post**: "There's a group of people hanging out near the park. Not sure what they're up to."

**Action**: üö´ Remove

**Rationale**: Tone invites speculation, even without direct accusations. The post lacks civic purpose and could contribute to stigmatization.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 15: Encouraging Civic Engagement with a Specific Location

**Post**: "The city is holding a meeting at the community center on 3rd Street to discuss safety concerns. Let's show up and share our thoughts!"

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: Encourages civic engagement respectfully and constructively. The location detail serves a legitimate civic purpose.

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways for Contextual Interpretation

1. **Consider Tone and Intent**: Evaluate not just what is said, but how and why it's said.
2. **Preserve Civic Engagement**: Allow posts that encourage constructive community involvement.
3. **Monitor Comment Escalation**: Be prepared to remove individual comments or entire threads if tone deteriorates.
4. **Balance Safety and Expression**: Protect against harm while preserving legitimate community concerns.
5. **Evaluate Context**: Consider the broader context and purpose of posts, not just individual words.

*Curated with Copilot - August 14, 2025*

**Current version:** Loading...  
*Last updated: August 15, 2025*

This guide helps moderators apply the **Contextual Interpretation** approach to moderation. This approach allows posts that are respectful, civic-minded, and avoid identifying individuals, while considering tone and intent. It includes specific prompting questions and test examples for training.

## üìã Table of Contents

- [‚öñÔ∏è Contextual Interpretation Philosophy](#contextual-interpretation-philosophy)
- [üîç Moderator Prompts](#moderator-prompts)

## ‚öñÔ∏è Contextual Interpretation Philosophy

**Allow posts that are respectful, civic-minded, and avoid identifying individuals. Tone and intent matter.**

This approach takes a balanced stance that considers the context, tone, and purpose of posts. It allows for civic engagement while maintaining community standards. The philosophy is that respectful, constructive content should be preserved, even if it touches on sensitive topics.

---

## üîç Moderator Prompts

When evaluating posts using the Contextual Interpretation approach, ask yourself:

- Is the post written in neutral, factual language?
- Does it avoid naming individuals or showing identifying details?
- Is the purpose clearly civic (e.g. encouraging outreach to officials, raising awareness)?
- Are comments respectful and constructive‚Äîor are they escalating into shaming or hostility?
- Would removing this post silence a legitimate concern, or prevent stigmatization?

---

## ‚úÖ Allow If

Posts are **allowed** if they meet **ALL** of these criteria:

- The post avoids personal identifiers and uses neutral tone.
- It encourages civic action (e.g. reporting to city services) rather than public judgment.
- Comments remain civil and focused on solutions.
- The purpose is clearly civic engagement or community awareness.
- No specific individuals are named or targeted.

---

## üö´ Remove If

Posts are **removed** if **ANY** of these conditions are met:

- The post includes accusations or identifying details (even if tone is respectful).
- Comments escalate into shaming or hostile speculation.
- The subject is a vulnerable group and the post risks amplifying stigma.
- The tone is inflammatory or invites divisive discussion.
- The purpose is to vent, target, or shame rather than inform.

---

## üß™ Test Examples for Contextual Approach

### ‚úÖ Usage Notes
- These test cases demonstrate how the Contextual Interpretation approach would handle various scenarios.
- Examples show the **balanced approach** that considers tone, intent, and civic value.
- Use these cases in training to reinforce the nuanced decision-making philosophy.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 1: Vague Concern Near Landmark

**Post**: "Something feels off near the old train station. Lots of people loitering and strange behavior. Just be careful."

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: No identifiers; tone is cautious but not accusatory. The post provides a general safety warning without targeting specific individuals.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 2: Direct Accusation Without Details

**Post**: "Someone in this neighborhood is selling drugs. I've seen shady exchanges but no proof."

**Action**: üö´ Remove

**Rationale**: Accusatory tone, even without identifiers. The post implies criminal behavior and invites speculation without providing constructive solutions.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 3: Civic Resource Sharing

**Post**: "If you're worried about safety, check out the city's new reporting app. It's a great way to stay involved."

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: Encourages civic engagement respectfully. The post provides a constructive resource without targeting individuals or locations.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 4: Comment Veers into Shaming

**Original Post**: "There's a group camping near the library. Just a heads-up."  
**Comment**: "They're disgusting. Always leaving trash and yelling at people."

**Action**: üö´ Remove Comment, Possibly Post

**Rationale**: Comment escalates tone with hostile language. The original post may be allowed if it's purely informational, but the comment violates tone standards.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 5: Photo Without Identifiers

**Post**: *Photo of a park bench* "This is where I saw someone passed out yesterday. Not sure what's going on."

**Action**: üö´ Remove

**Rationale**: Tone invites speculation, even without identifiers. The post implies wrongdoing and could stigmatize vulnerable individuals.

---

**Post**: "There's a tent near the trail. If you're concerned, contact outreach services. Let's be kind."

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: Tone is respectful, purpose is civic. The post encourages constructive action rather than judgment or speculation.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 7: Subtle Implication of Criminal Activity

**Post**: "I've noticed a lot of people hanging around the corner of 5th and Main late at night. It's making me uneasy."

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: No direct accusations; tone is cautious but not inflammatory. The post expresses a legitimate safety concern without targeting individuals.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 8: Sharing a News Article with a Loaded Caption

**Post**: *Shares a news article about a local crime* "This is why our neighborhood is going downhill. We need to do something about these people."

**Action**: üö´ Remove

**Rationale**: Tone of the caption invites divisive or harmful discussion. Even though the article itself is neutral, the caption violates tone standards.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 9: Hypothetical Scenario with Negative Implications

**Post**: "What if someone set up a tent in front of your house? How would you feel about that?"

**Action**: üö´ Remove

**Rationale**: While not directly accusatory, the tone is provocative and risks escalating tension. The hypothetical question invites divisive responses.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 10: Positive Post with a Specific Location

**Post**: "Shoutout to the volunteers cleaning up the park near 8th Street! You're making a difference!"

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: Positive tone and civic engagement outweigh location mention. The post celebrates community contribution rather than targeting individuals.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 11: Comment with Veiled Insult

**Original Post**: "There's a group of people near the library. Just a heads-up."  
**Comment**: "Well, some people just don't know how to behave in public."

**Action**: üö´ Remove Comment, Possibly Post

**Rationale**: Comment escalates tone with veiled insult. The original post may be allowed if it's purely informational, but the comment violates tone standards.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 12: Sharing a Resource with a Negative Anecdote

**Post**: "I saw someone struggling near the bus stop today. If you see this kind of thing, here's a hotline you can call to help."

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: Tone is compassionate and provides a helpful resource. The post encourages constructive action rather than judgment.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 13: Sarcastic Comment on a Neutral Post

**Original Post**: "There's a new community garden opening downtown. Check it out!"  
**Comment**: "Great, another place for people to trash."

**Action**: üö´ Remove Comment

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 14: Vague Concern About a Group

**Post**: "There's a group of people hanging out near the park. Not sure what they're up to."

**Action**: üö´ Remove

**Rationale**: Tone invites speculation, even without direct accusations. The post lacks civic purpose and could contribute to stigmatization.

---

### ‚úÖ Test Case 15: Encouraging Civic Engagement with a Specific Location

**Post**: "The city is holding a meeting at the community center on 3rd Street to discuss safety concerns. Let's show up and share our thoughts!"

**Action**: ‚úÖ Allow

**Rationale**: Encourages civic engagement respectfully and constructively. The location detail serves a legitimate civic purpose.

---

## üéØ Key Takeaways for Contextual Interpretation

1. **Consider Tone and Intent**: Evaluate not just what is said, but how and why it's said.
