## 🛑 Strict Interpretation Philosophy

**Prioritize protection from public shaming. Posts with geo-tagging or identifying details are removed regardless of tone.**

This approach takes a zero-tolerance stance on any content that could potentially identify individuals, locations, or invite public judgment. The philosophy is that it's better to remove potentially problematic content than risk public shaming or stigmatization.

---

## 🔍 Moderator Prompts

When evaluating posts using the Strict Interpretation approach, ask yourself:

- Does the post include a specific location (e.g. address, coordinates, nearby landmarks) tied to a complaint or accusation?
- Is there any identifying detail (e.g. license plate, tent description, photos of people or property)?
- Even if the language is civil, does the post imply wrongdoing or invite judgment?
- Would a reasonable reader interpret this as targeting or stigmatizing a person or group?
- Is the issue better suited for direct reporting to city officials than public posting?

---

## ✅ Allow Only If

Posts are **only allowed** if they meet **ALL** of these criteria:

- The post shares general safety tips or resources without referencing specific locations or individuals.
- The post encourages civic engagement without identifying or describing people or places.
- No geographic markers, landmarks, or identifying details are mentioned.
- The tone is purely informational or educational.

---

## 🚫 Remove If

Posts are **automatically removed** if **ANY** of these conditions are met:

- Any geo-tagging or identifying detail is present.
- The post includes accusations, even if phrased politely.
- The subject is a vulnerable population (e.g. homeless individuals) and the tone could be interpreted as stigmatizing.
- Specific locations, addresses, or landmarks are mentioned in any context.
- Photos or descriptions that could identify individuals or property.
- Any implication of wrongdoing, even without direct accusations.

### ✅ Test Case 1: Vague Concern Near Landmark

**Post**: "Something feels off near the old train station. Lots of people loitering and strange behavior. Just be careful."

**Action**: 🚫 Remove

**Rationale**: Mentions a specific location ("old train station") and implies wrongdoing ("strange behavior"). Even though the tone is cautious rather than accusatory, the strict approach removes any post with location-specific details.

---

### ✅ Test Case 2: Direct Accusation Without Details

**Post**: "Someone in this neighborhood is selling drugs. I've seen shady exchanges but no proof."

**Action**: 🚫 Remove

**Rationale**: Implies criminal behavior without evidence. The strict approach removes any post with accusations, regardless of whether specific identifiers are present.

---

### ✅ Test Case 3: Civic Resource Sharing

**Post**: "If you're worried about safety, check out the city's new reporting app. It's a great way to stay involved."

**Action**: ✅ Allow

**Rationale**: No identifiers or accusations. This post shares general safety resources without referencing specific locations or individuals.

---

### ✅ Test Case 4: Comment Veers into Shaming

**Original Post**: "There's a group camping near the library. Just a heads-up."  
**Comment**: "They're disgusting. Always leaving trash and yelling at people."

**Action**: 🚫 Remove Entire Thread

**Rationale**: The original post identifies a specific location ("near the library") and the comment escalates into hostile language. The strict approach removes the entire thread when location details are present.

---

### ✅ Test Case 5: Photo Without Identifiers

**Post**: *Photo of a park bench* "This is where I saw someone passed out yesterday. Not sure what's going on."

**Action**: 🚫 Remove

**Rationale**: Implies wrongdoing, location is specific ("park bench"), and mentions a vulnerable individual. The strict approach removes any post with location details and implications of concerning behavior.

---

### ✅ Test Case 6: Respectful Outreach

**Post**: "There's a tent near the trail. If you're concerned, contact outreach services. Let's be kind."

**Action**: 🚫 Remove

**Rationale**: Mentions location ("near the trail") and vulnerable population (tent/homeless individuals). Even with respectful tone, the strict approach removes posts that identify locations of vulnerable populations.

---

### ✅ Test Case 7: Subtle Implication of Criminal Activity

**Post**: "I've noticed a lot of people hanging around the corner of 5th and Main late at night. It's making me uneasy."

**Action**: 🚫 Remove

**Rationale**: Mentions a specific location ("corner of 5th and Main") and implies wrongdoing ("making me uneasy"). The strict approach removes any post with precise location details.

**Post**: *Shares a news article about a local crime* "This is why our neighborhood is going downhill. We need to do something about these people."

**Action**: 🚫 Remove

**Rationale**: Caption is inflammatory and risks targeting specific groups. The strict approach removes any post that could contribute to stigmatization or public judgment.

---

### ✅ Test Case 9: Hypothetical Scenario with Negative Implications

**Post**: "What if someone set up a tent in front of your house? How would you feel about that?"

**Post**: "Shoutout to the volunteers cleaning up the park near 8th Street! You're making a difference!"

**Action**: 🚫 Remove

**Original Post**: "There's a group of people near the library. Just a heads-up."  
**Comment**: "Well, some people just don't know how to behave in public."

**Action**: 🚫 Remove Entire Thread

**Rationale**: Location mention ("near the library") + comment with veiled insult. The strict approach removes the entire thread when location details are present.

---

### ✅ Test Case 12: Sharing a Resource with a Negative Anecdote
