This guide helps moderators apply the **Strict Interpretation** approach to moderation. This approach prioritizes protection from public shaming by removing posts with geo-tagging or identifying details regardless of tone.

## üõë Strict Interpretation Philosophy

**Prioritize protection from public shaming. Posts with geo-tagging or identifying details are removed regardless of tone.**

This approach takes a zero-tolerance stance on any content that could potentially identify individuals, locations, or invite public judgment. The philosophy is that it's better to remove potentially problematic content than risk public shaming or stigmatization.

## üîç Moderator Prompts

When evaluating posts using the Strict Interpretation approach, ask yourself:

- Does the post include a specific location (e.g. address, coordinates, nearby landmarks) tied to a complaint or accusation?
- Is there any identifying detail (e.g. license plate, tent description, photos of people or property)?
- Even if the language is civil, does the post imply wrongdoing or invite judgment?
- Would a reasonable reader interpret this as targeting or stigmatizing a person or group?
- Is the issue better suited for direct reporting to city officials than public posting?

## ‚úÖ Allow Only If

Posts are **only allowed** if they meet **ALL** of these criteria:

- The post shares general safety tips or resources without referencing specific locations or individuals.
- The post encourages civic engagement without identifying or describing people or places.
- No geographic markers, landmarks, or identifying details are mentioned.
- The tone is purely informational or educational.

## üö´ Remove If

Posts are **automatically removed** if **ANY** of these conditions are met:

- Any geo-tagging or identifying detail is present.
- The post includes accusations, even if phrased politely.
- The subject is a vulnerable population (e.g. homeless individuals) and the tone could be interpreted as stigmatizing.
- Specific locations, addresses, or landmarks are mentioned in any context.
- Photos or descriptions that could identify individuals or property.
- Any implication of wrongdoing, even without direct accusations.

## üéØ Key Principles

- **Zero Tolerance**: Any identifying details result in automatic removal
- **Safety First**: Protection from public shaming is the highest priority
- **No Exceptions**: Tone and intent don't override identifying content
- **Proactive Protection**: Remove content that could potentially cause harm
- **Official Reporting**: Encourage direct contact with authorities rather than public posting
