This guide helps moderators apply the **Hybrid Approach** to moderation. This approach allows posts that meet strict criteria, but requires active monitoring and intervention to prevent escalation.

## üß™ Hybrid Approach Philosophy

**Allow posts that meet strict criteria, but monitor and moderate comments to prevent escalation.**

This approach takes a middle ground that allows for civic engagement while maintaining strict oversight. It requires moderators to be actively involved in monitoring conversations and intervening when needed. The philosophy is that posts can be allowed if they meet baseline standards, but ongoing vigilance is essential.

## üîç Moderator Prompts

When evaluating posts using the Hybrid Approach, ask yourself:

- Does the post meet baseline criteria: neutral tone, no identifiers, civic purpose?
- Is the location shared general (e.g. "near Main & 5th") rather than precise?
- Are commenters maintaining a respectful tone‚Äîor veering into speculation or judgment?
- Has the post sparked concern or confusion among neighbors?
- Is the moderator prepared to actively monitor and intervene in comments?

## ‚úÖ Allow If

Posts are **allowed** if they meet **ALL** of these criteria:

- The post is respectful, avoids identifiers, and encourages civic engagement.
- Location is shared only to help neighbors report to officials‚Äînot to shame or speculate.
- Moderator is prepared to monitor and intervene in comments.
- The tone is neutral or positive.
- The purpose is clearly civic engagement or community awareness.

## üö´ Remove or Intervene If

Posts are **removed or require intervention** if **ANY** of these conditions are met:

- Comments begin to include accusations, personal details, or hostile language.
- The post is being used as a platform for venting or targeting rather than informing.
- The subject is a vulnerable population and the conversation risks stigmatization.
- The conversation escalates beyond the original post's intent.
- Neighbors express concern or confusion about the post's purpose.

## üéØ Key Principles

- **Active Monitoring**: Continuous oversight of conversations is required
- **Balanced Approach**: Allow constructive content while maintaining strict oversight
- **Intervention Ready**: Be prepared to step in when conversations escalate
- **Civic Focus**: Posts must serve community engagement purposes
- **Risk Management**: Monitor for potential escalation and intervene proactively
