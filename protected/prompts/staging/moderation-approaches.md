This guide helps moderators navigate the gray area between civic engagement and public shaming—especially when posts involve sensitive topics like homeless encampments or suspected illegal activity. It includes three moderation approaches, prompting questions, and test examples for training.

## 🎯 Quick Comparison of Approaches

| Aspect | Strict | Contextual | Hybrid |
|--------|---------|------------|---------|
| **Location Details** | 🚫 Never allowed | ✅ Allowed if positive/civic | ✅ Allowed if general + civic |
| **Tone Consideration** | ❌ Irrelevant | ✅ Critical factor | ✅ Important but not primary |
| **Monitoring Required** | ❌ Minimal | ⚠️ Moderate | ✅ Extensive |
| **Comment Moderation** | 🚫 Remove entire threads | 🚫 Remove problematic comments | 🚫 Remove comments + monitor |
| **Civic Value** | ❌ Secondary to safety | ✅ Primary consideration | ✅ Important but not overriding |

### **Quick Reference Guide:**

**🛑 Strict Approach**: Zero tolerance for any location details or accusations. Safety first, engagement second.

**⚖️ Contextual Approach**: Balanced consideration of tone, intent, and civic value. Respectful content is preserved.

**🧪 Hybrid Approach**: Allows posts meeting strict criteria but requires active monitoring and intervention.

## 🔀 Moderation Philosophies

### 🛑 Option A: Strict Interpretation

#### Philosophy
Prioritize protection from public shaming. Posts with geo-tagging or identifying details are removed regardless of tone.

#### 🔍 Moderator Prompts
- Does the post include a specific location (e.g. address, coordinates, nearby landmarks) tied to a complaint or accusation?
- Is there any identifying detail (e.g. license plate, tent description, photos of people or property)?
- Even if the language is civil, does the post imply wrongdoing or invite judgment?
- Would a reasonable reader interpret this as targeting or stigmatizing a person or group?
- Is the issue better suited for direct reporting to city officials than public posting?

#### ✅ Allow Only If
- The post shares general safety tips or resources without referencing specific locations or individuals.
- The post encourages civic engagement without identifying or describing people or places.

#### 🚫 Remove If
- Any geo-tagging or identifying detail is present.
- The post includes accusations, even if phrased politely.
- The subject is a vulnerable population (e.g. homeless individuals) and the tone could be interpreted as stigmatizing.

---

### ⚖️ Option B: Contextual Interpretation

#### Philosophy
Allow posts that are respectful, civic-minded, and avoid identifying individuals. Tone and intent matter.

#### 🔍 Moderator Prompts
- Is the post written in neutral, factual language?
- Does it avoid naming individuals or showing identifying details?
- Is the purpose clearly civic (e.g. encouraging outreach to officials, raising awareness)?
- Are comments respectful and constructive—or are they escalating into shaming or hostility?
- Would removing this post silence a legitimate concern, or prevent stigmatization?

#### ✅ Allow If
- The post avoids personal identifiers and uses neutral tone.
- It encourages civic action (e.g. reporting to city services) rather than public judgment.
- Comments remain civil and focused on solutions.

#### 🚫 Remove If
- The post includes accusations or identifying details (even if tone is respectful).
- Comments escalate into shaming or hostile speculation.
- The subject is a vulnerable group and the post risks amplifying stigma.

---

### 🧪 Option C: Hybrid Approach

#### Philosophy
Allow posts that meet strict criteria, but monitor and moderate comments to prevent escalation.

#### 🔍 Moderator Prompts
- Does the post meet baseline criteria: neutral tone, no identifiers, civic purpose?
- Is the location shared general (e.g. "near Main & 5th") rather than precise?
- Are commenters maintaining a respectful tone—or veering into speculation or judgment?
- Has the post sparked concern or confusion among neighbors?

#### ✅ Allow If
- The post is respectful, avoids identifiers, and encourages civic engagement.
- Location is shared only to help neighbors report to officials—not to shame or speculate.
- Moderator is prepared to monitor and intervene in comments.

#### 🚫 Remove or Intervene If
- Comments begin to include accusations, personal details, or hostile language.
- The post is being used as a platform for venting or targeting rather than informing.
- The subject is a vulnerable population and the conversation risks stigmatization.

## 🧪 Moderation Test Examples

### ✅ Usage Notes
- These test cases are designed to reinforce consistency across moderation styles.
- Comments should be evaluated separately from posts when tone diverges.
- Use these cases in training, onboarding, or calibration exercises.

Each test case includes:
- **Scenario**: A post or comment from the community
- **Expected Action**: What each moderation style would do
- **Rationale**: Why that action aligns with the philosophy
