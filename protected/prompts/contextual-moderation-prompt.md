This guide helps moderators apply the **Contextual Interpretation** approach to moderation. This approach allows posts that are respectful, civic-minded, and avoid identifying individuals, while considering tone and intent.

## ‚öñÔ∏è Contextual Interpretation Philosophy

**Allow posts that are respectful, civic-minded, and avoid identifying individuals. Tone and intent matter.**

This approach takes a balanced stance that considers the context, tone, and purpose of posts. It allows for civic engagement while maintaining community standards. The philosophy is that respectful, constructive content should be preserved, even if it touches on sensitive topics.

## üîç Moderator Prompts

When evaluating posts using the Contextual Interpretation approach, ask yourself:

- Is the post written in neutral, factual language?
- Does it avoid naming individuals or showing identifying details?
- Is the purpose clearly civic (e.g. encouraging outreach to officials, raising awareness)?
- Are comments respectful and constructive‚Äîor are they escalating into shaming or hostility?
- Would removing this post silence a legitimate concern, or prevent stigmatization?

## ‚úÖ Allow If

Posts are **allowed** if they meet **ALL** of these criteria:

- The post avoids personal identifiers and uses neutral tone.
- It encourages civic action (e.g. reporting to city services) rather than public judgment.
- Comments remain civil and focused on solutions.
- The purpose is clearly civic engagement or community awareness.
- No specific individuals are named or targeted.

## üö´ Remove If

Posts are **removed** if **ANY** of these conditions are met:

- The post includes accusations or identifying details (even if tone is respectful).
- Comments escalate into shaming or hostile speculation.
- The subject is a vulnerable group and the post risks amplifying stigma.
- The tone is inflammatory or invites divisive discussion.
- The purpose is to vent, target, or shame rather than inform.

## üéØ Key Principles

- **Tone Matters**: Respectful, constructive content is valued
- **Civic Purpose**: Posts should encourage community engagement, not personal judgment
- **Balanced Approach**: Consider both the content and the intent
- **Community Protection**: Err on the side of preserving constructive dialogue
- **Active Monitoring**: Be prepared to intervene if conversations escalate
