## 🧪 Hybrid Approach Philosophy

**Allow posts that meet strict criteria, but monitor and moderate comments to prevent escalation.**

This approach takes a middle ground that allows for civic engagement while maintaining strict oversight. It requires moderators to be actively involved in monitoring conversations and intervening when needed. The philosophy is that posts can be allowed if they meet baseline standards, but ongoing vigilance is essential.

---

## 🔍 Moderator Prompts

When evaluating posts using the Hybrid Approach, ask yourself:

- Does the post meet baseline criteria: neutral tone, no identifiers, civic purpose?
- Is the location shared general (e.g. "near Main & 5th") rather than precise?
- Are commenters maintaining a respectful tone—or veering into speculation or judgment?
- Has the post sparked concern or confusion among neighbors?
- Is the moderator prepared to actively monitor and intervene in comments?

---

## ✅ Allow If

Posts are **allowed** if they meet **ALL** of these criteria:

- The post is respectful, avoids identifiers, and encourages civic engagement.
- Location is shared only to help neighbors report to officials—not to shame or speculate.
- Moderator is prepared to monitor and intervene in comments.
- The tone is neutral or positive.
- The purpose is clearly civic engagement or community awareness.

---

## 🚫 Remove or Intervene If

Posts are **removed or require intervention** if **ANY** of these conditions are met:

- Comments begin to include accusations, personal details, or hostile language.
- The post is being used as a platform for venting or targeting rather than informing.
- The subject is a vulnerable population and the conversation risks stigmatization.
- The conversation escalates beyond the original post's intent.
- Neighbors express concern or confusion about the post's purpose.

## 🧪 Test Examples for Hybrid Approach

### ✅ Usage Notes
- These test cases demonstrate how the Hybrid Approach would handle various scenarios.
- Examples show the **monitoring and intervention** approach that requires ongoing vigilance.
- Use these cases in training to reinforce the active moderation philosophy.

---

### ✅ Test Case 1: Vague Concern Near Landmark

**Post**: "Something feels off near the old train station. Lots of people loitering and strange behavior. Just be careful."

**Action**: ✅ Allow

**Rationale**: Location is general; monitor comments for escalation. The post provides a safety warning without specific accusations, but requires monitoring to ensure comments don't escalate.

---

### ✅ Test Case 2: Direct Accusation Without Details

**Post**: "Someone in this neighborhood is selling drugs. I've seen shady exchanges but no proof."

**Action**: 🚫 Remove

**Rationale**: Risks speculation and stigma without civic value. Even without identifiers, the accusatory tone makes this post unsuitable for the hybrid approach.

---

### ✅ Test Case 3: Civic Resource Sharing

**Post**: "If you're worried about safety, check out the city's new reporting app. It's a great way to stay involved."

**Action**: ✅ Allow

**Rationale**: Fully aligned with all criteria. The post encourages civic engagement without any risk factors, making it safe to allow without extensive monitoring.

---

### ✅ Test Case 4: Comment Veers into Shaming

**Original Post**: "There's a group camping near the library. Just a heads-up."  
**Comment**: "They're disgusting. Always leaving trash and yelling at people."

**Action**: ✅ Allow Post, 🚫 Remove Comment

**Rationale**: Post is neutral; comment violates tone standards. The hybrid approach allows the informational post while immediately removing the hostile comment.

---

### ✅ Test Case 5: Photo Without Identifiers

**Post**: *Photo of a park bench* "This is where I saw someone passed out yesterday. Not sure what's going on."

**Action**: 🚫 Remove

**Rationale**: Risks stigmatization and lacks civic purpose. The post implies wrongdoing and could contribute to negative perceptions of vulnerable individuals.

---

### ✅ Test Case 6: Respectful Outreach

**Post**: "There's a tent near the trail. If you're concerned, contact outreach services. Let's be kind."

**Action**: ✅ Allow

**Rationale**: Meets criteria; monitor comments if needed. The post is respectful and provides constructive resources, but requires monitoring to ensure the conversation remains helpful.

---

### ✅ Test Case 7: Subtle Implication of Criminal Activity

**Post**: "I've noticed a lot of people hanging around the corner of 5th and Main late at night. It's making me uneasy."

**Action**: ✅ Allow

**Rationale**: Location is specific but does not explicitly accuse anyone; monitor for escalation in comments. The post expresses a legitimate concern while requiring careful monitoring.

---

### ✅ Test Case 8: Sharing a News Article with a Loaded Caption

**Post**: *Shares a news article about a local crime* "This is why our neighborhood is going downhill. We need to do something about these people."

**Action**: 🚫 Remove

**Rationale**: While the article itself is neutral, the caption violates tone standards. The hybrid approach doesn't allow posts that start with inflammatory language.

---

### ✅ Test Case 9: Hypothetical Scenario with Negative Implications

**Post**: "What if someone set up a tent in front of your house? How would you feel about that?"

**Action**: 🚫 Remove

**Rationale**: Risks unproductive or harmful discussion without adding civic value. The hypothetical question could escalate into divisive conversation.

---

### ✅ Test Case 10: Positive Post with a Specific Location

**Post**: "Shoutout to the volunteers cleaning up the park near 8th Street! You're making a difference!"

**Action**: ✅ Allow

**Rationale**: Fully aligned with civic purpose; no risk of harm or speculation. The positive tone and community celebration make this post safe to allow.

### ✅ Test Case 11: Comment with Veiled Insult

**Original Post**: "There's a group of people near the library. Just a heads-up."  
**Comment**: "Well, some people just don't know how to behave in public."

**Action**: ✅ Allow Post, 🚫 Remove Comment

**Rationale**: Post is neutral; comment violates tone standards. The hybrid approach preserves the informational post while removing the problematic comment.

---

### ✅ Test Case 12: Sharing a Resource with a Negative Anecdote

**Post**: "I saw someone struggling near the bus stop today. If you see this kind of thing, here's a hotline you can call to help."

**Action**: ✅ Allow

**Rationale**: Meets criteria; monitor comments for potential escalation. The post provides helpful resources while requiring monitoring to ensure the conversation remains constructive.

---

### ✅ Test Case 13: Sarcastic Comment on a Neutral Post

**Original Post**: "There's a new community garden opening downtown. Check it out!"  
**Comment**: "Great, another place for people to trash."

**Action**: ✅ Allow Post, 🚫 Remove Comment

**Rationale**: Post is positive; comment violates tone standards. The hybrid approach allows the positive post while removing the sarcastic comment.

---

### ✅ Test Case 14: Vague Concern About a Group

**Post**: "There's a group of people hanging out near the park. Not sure what they're up to."

**Action**: 🚫 Remove

**Rationale**: Risks stigmatization and lacks civic purpose. The post invites speculation without providing constructive solutions or civic value.

---

### ✅ Test Case 15: Encouraging Civic Engagement with a Specific Location

**Post**: "The city is holding a meeting at the community center on 3rd Street to discuss safety concerns. Let's show up and share our thoughts!"
